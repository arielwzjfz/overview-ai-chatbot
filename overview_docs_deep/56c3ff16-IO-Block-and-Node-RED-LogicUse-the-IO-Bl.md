Thank you for your feedback\!

Use the IO Block menu to define Pass/Fail rules for each captured image, and use a built-in Node-RED editor to customize digital IO functions, complex logic, and web-based dashboards and user interfaces.

Configuring IO is typically one of the final steps in the process of building a Recipe.

## Node-RED

Node-RED is a low-code, browser-based environment for programming event-driven applications. On top of Node-RED, the OV20i contains Overview-specific nodes to make it easy to set up basic inspection logic without coding. These include the OV20i default flow and multiple custom nodes.

### **Node-RED Basics**

#### **Context Tab**

Description: Node-RED provides a method for storing information that can be shared between different nodes without relying on messages that pass through a flow.

Functionality: Context storage allows for the preservation and sharing of data across various nodes and flows within a Node-RED environment. This can be useful for maintaining state, sharing configuration data, or caching information.

Context Scopes: The 'scope' of a particular context value determines who can access it. There are three context scope levels:

  * Node Context:

    * Scope: Only visible to the node that set the value.

    * Use Case: This type of storage is ideal for storing data specific to a single node, such as temporary state information or local settings.

  * Flow Context:

    * Scope: Visible to all nodes on the same flow \(or tab in the editor\).

    * Use Case: This is useful for sharing data between nodes within the same flow, such as shared configuration data or intermediate results.

  * Global Context:

    * Scope: Visible to all nodes across all flows.

    * Use Case: Suitable for data that needs to be accessed by any node within the Node-RED instance, such as global configuration settings or application-wide state.




Key Features:

  * Node Context: Limited to the node that sets the value, ensuring encapsulated data handling.

  * Flow Context: Accessible by all nodes within the same flow, facilitating shared data usage.

  * Global Context: Available to all nodes, sharing data globally across the Node-RED instance.




Usage Scenarios:

  * Node Context: Storing temporary state information or local settings only relevant to a single node.

  * Flow Context: Sharing intermediate results or configuration data between nodes within the same flow.

  * Global Context: Maintaining global configuration settings or application-wide state information that needs to be accessible by any node.




Benefits:

  * Data Persistence: Allows data to be stored and accessed without passing through message flows.

  * Scope Flexibility: Provides different levels of data sharing, from node-specific to global access.

  * State Management: Facilitates the management of state and configuration data across nodes and flows.




#### **Deploy Button**

Description: The "Deploy Button" in Node-RED is a critical editor component, allowing users to manage, apply, and push configurations to their Node-RED instances. A running configuration consists of several Flow objects, each corresponding to a node in the editor. Additionally, a global Flow object manages global configuration nodes and subflow definitions.

Functionality:

  * Flow Object: Defined in red/runtime/nodes/flows/Flow.js, the Flow object is responsible for creating, starting, and stopping all the nodes it contains. When a Flow object is created, it receives its own configuration and a reference to the global Flow object, allowing access to global configurations and sub-flows.

  * Node Object: The basic Node object, defined in red/runtime/nodes/Node.js, is instantiated by the Flow object. For subflow instances, local instances of each node within the subflow are created.

  * Full Deploy: During a full deployment, the Flow object instantiates all the Node objects it owns. Conversely, all nodes are stopped and cleaned up when a flow is stopped.

Modified-Nodes/Flows Deploy: When deploying only modified nodes or flows, the start/stop functions utilize a different object to identify changes and update only the necessary components.




Flow Object Management:

  * The creation and management of Flow objects are handled by the runtime in red/runtime/nodes/flows/index.js.

  * The runtime processes the flow configuration provided via the admin API, converting the flat array of node objects into a structured format.

  * This structured object is then split and passed to individual Flow objects.

  * In the case of modified nodes/flows deployments, the runtime generates the diff between configurations to determine necessary updates.




Key Features:

  * Flow Management: Handles the creation, starting, and stopping of nodes within each Flow object.

  * Global Access: Each Flow object has access to global configurations and subflows through a reference to the global Flow object.

  * Efficient Deployment: Supports full and modified nodes/flows deployments, ensuring efficient updates and minimal disruption.

  * Runtime Integration: Managed by the runtime, providing seamless integration with the Node-RED admin API and configuration processes.




Usage Scenarios:

  * Flow Creation: Automatically handles the instantiation of nodes and subflow instances when a new flow is created.

  * Flow Updates: Efficiently updates only modified nodes or flows during deployment, reducing downtime and improving performance.

  * Global Configuration: Ensures that all flows have access to global configurations and subflows, promoting consistency and reuse.
