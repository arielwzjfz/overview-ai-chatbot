| **Upload** : Drag and drop an update file \(.ovupdate\) here or click to select a file.  
---|---  
| **Preferences** : By default, the camera will begin installing the update once the file is uploaded. Toggle this option off to begin installation manually once the file is uploaded.  
| **All Updates** : This section lists all of the update files that have been uploaded to the camera. This includes updates which have already been installed. Click **Delete** to remove an update file from the camera, or click **Install** to begin installing the update.

> **Warning** Make sure you select the latest version when installing. If an older software version is selected, the camera software will be rolled back. The automatic installation option helps to prevent this.
