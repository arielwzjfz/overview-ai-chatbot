If youâ€™re having difficulty connecting to the camera, first ensure youâ€™ve followed the steps in [Connecting to the OV20i Software](https://docs.overview.ai/v1/docs/electrical-and-communication#connecting-to-the-ov20i-software) correctly and canâ€™t use the USB-C port for communication.

## The camera is not connecting with the configured IP

When connecting your computer to the camera, it's important to ensure both devices are on the same subnet. If your computer and camera have different subnet configurations, your computer may not be able to locate the camera, and the connection may fail. To avoid this issue, check your computer's ethernet adapter TCP/IP settings and ensure that they match the subnet configuration of the camera. If they don't match, you can change the settings to match the camera's subnet configuration. Once both devices are on the same subnet, you should be able to establish a proper connection and access the camera's software.  


> **Tip**
> 
> For help configuring your ethernet adapterâ€™s IP address, refer to the links below:

> 
> [Mac - Change TCP/IP settings \(Apple Support\)](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-tcpip-settings-on-mac-mh14129/mac)

  * IP addresses are formatted as **XXX.XXX.XXX.YYY**. It is usually defined by your IT department, where the **XXX.XXX.XXX** should be identical across all devices, and **YYY** is device-specific, so choose an IP for your computer that is not used by any other device on the line.

  * For example, if you want to create a subnet for all your cameras on the line, you can use the IP address range of **192.168.0.1** to **192.168.0.254**. This subnet can be identified by the subnet mask of **255.255.255.0**. Devices within this subnet will have IP addresses like **192.168.0.1** , **192.168.0.2** , and so on, and your laptop IP should be **192.168.0.YYY** \(where **YYY** is unique and not taken by any other device\).

  * Similarly, if you want to create a different subnet for your barcode readers, you can use the IP address range of **192.168.1.1** to **192.168.1.254**. This subnet can be identified by the subnet mask of **255.255.255.0**. Devices within this subnet will have IP addresses like **192.168.1.1** , **192.168.1.2** , and so on, and your laptop IP should be **192.168.1.YYY** \(where **YYY** is unique and not taken by any other device\).

## The camera is not connecting to Profinet/Ethernet IP

If all the TCP/IP settings are correct but you are still unable to ping or connect to the camera, the best way to connect would be through the micro USB port on the camera:

  1. Remove the rubber side flap on the OV20i to expose the auxiliary connections. Connect a micro USB cable from the camera \(see image\) to the computer you will use to connect to the OV20i.

  2. Open your browser and enter the IP address **192.168.55.1** to connect to the OV20i software.  


> **Note**
> 
> This IP address never changes and does not require configuration of your network adapter.




## The camera is still not connecting

There is a possibility that the cameraâ€™s IP is not unique.

To ensure effective communication between devices on a network, it's important to assign unique IP addresses to each device, including your camera. This is because sharing IP addresses can cause conflicts and disrupt connectivity. To avoid these conflicts, you can use an IP scanner tool to detect any shared IP addresses and adjust the IP settings of one or more devices. By assigning unique IP addresses to every device, you can optimize the performance of your camera and other networked devices and establish a seamless connection. This will help you get the most out of your camera and ensure your network operates smoothly.  


> ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind**
> 
> Your network might be utilizing the same IP as the camera, like **192.168.0.100** \(some routers have the same default IP\). This can cause a confusion as there is an IP conflict, so it is best to connect with a Micro USB and change the IP to unique IP setting.
