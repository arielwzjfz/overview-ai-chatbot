## Mounting and lens selection

  1. Go to [overview.ai/calculator-for-ov20i](http://overview.ai/calculator-for-ov20i) or use the chart below to calculate the mounting height required for your Field of View \(FoV\). The OV20i is fitted with a 12mm lens. Other lenses sold separately \(see [Recommended Accessories](/docs/recommended-accessories) and [Swapping the Lens](https://docs.overview.ai/docs/mounting-and-mechanical#swapping-the-lens)\).

> **Note**
> 
> The camera has a 4:3 aspect ratio. Multiply the width by 0.75 to calculate the height.

  2. Mount the camera using the plate and hardware provided.

> **Note**
> 
> It’s normal for the OV20i to become hot to touch when powered. For high temperature environments, use the front mounting points.

  1. Connect the I/O Power cable to the camera and to a power supply.

  2. Connect a computer to the camera by either:

     * **Micro USB**

Connect a micro USB cable at the side of the camera. Open your browser and go to **192.168.55.1**.

     * **Ethernet**

Connect the Ethernet cable to the camera. Configure your Ethernet adapter to IP **192.168.0.10** \(Subnet mask **255.255.255.0**\), and then open your web browser and go to **192.168.0.100**.
