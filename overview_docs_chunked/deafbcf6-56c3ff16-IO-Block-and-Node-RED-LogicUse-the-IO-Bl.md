### **Node-RED Dashboard**

Description: The Node-RED Dashboard provides a web-based interface for Node-RED, enabling users to create and display live data visualizations, control interfaces, and dashboards. This functionality is essential for real-time monitoring and interaction with Node-RED flows.

Functionality:

  * User Interface Creation:

    * It allows users to design custom dashboards with various UI components, such as charts, gauges, text, sliders, buttons, and more.

    * Components can be arranged and styled to create intuitive and functional interfaces.

  * Real-Time Data Visualization:

    * Displays real-time data from Node-RED flows, providing immediate insights into system performance and metrics.

    * Supports dynamic updates, ensuring that the dashboard reflects the latest data.

  * Control Interfaces:

    * Includes interactive elements like buttons and sliders to control flows and processes directly from the dashboard.

    * Enables users to send commands and adjust settings without needing to access the Node-RED editor.

  * Responsive Design:

    * Dashboards are accessible from any device with a web browser, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

    * Ensures that the dashboard layout adjusts appropriately to different screen sizes and orientations.




Key Components:

  * Layout Manager:

    * Provides a drag-and-drop interface for arranging UI components on the dashboard.

    * Allows users to create a structured and organized layout.

  * UI Nodes:

    * Various nodes are available to add functionality to the dashboard, including:

    * ui\_button: Adds buttons for triggering actions.

      *     * ui\_chart: Displays line, bar, and pie charts for visualizing data trends.

      *     * ui\_gauge: Shows gauge meters for monitoring values within a range.

      *     * ui\_text: Displays static or dynamic text values.

      *     * ui\_slider: Allows users to adjust values using a slider control.

      *   * Theme Customization:

    * Users can customize the dashboard's appearance, including colors, fonts, and styles, to match their preferences or corporate branding.




Steps to Create a Dashboard:

  * Add UI Nodes to Flows:

    * You can drag and drop UI nodes from the palette into your flows to define the data and controls you want to include in the dashboard.

  * Configure UI Nodes:

    * Configure the properties of each UI node, such as labels, ranges, and data sources.

  * Arrange Components:

    * Use the layout manager to arrange the UI components on the dashboard, creating a logical and user-friendly layout.

  * Deploy and Access Dashboard:

    * Deploy your flows and access the dashboard by navigating to the appropriate URL \(typically **http://\{hostname\}:1880/api/ui**\).




Usage Scenarios:

  * Control Interfaces:

Provide users with interactive controls to manage and adjust processes, such as turning devices on or off, setting thresholds, or adjusting configurations based on your cameraâ€™s output.

  * Data Visualization:

Create visual representations of data trends, helping users to analyze and interpret complex information quickly.

  * User Interaction:

Enable end-users to interact with the Node-RED application without technical knowledge of the underlying flows.
