### Power I/O Connector Pinout and Wiring

> **Important**
> 
> If wire color coding varies, refer to the labels for the correct pinout.

> **Note**
> 
>   1. When active, output sinks to GND. Max 200mA. When not active, output is floating. Requires an external power supply.
> 
>   2. Pull to GND to activate input.
> 
>   3. Pull to GND to reboot the camera. This is not needed for most applications. Keep floating to avoid unexpected restarts.
> 
>   4. DIO GND \(Common In\) must be connected to GND for digital input functionality to work. DIO GND \(Common In\) is tied to GND through a thermal fuse. When connecting the OV80iâ€™s digital I/O lines to a system that is powered from a different power supply, use this pin to tie the grounds together.
