#### **Capture Metadata**

Description:The "Metadata Assignment Node" is designed to set the metadata associated with each capture. This metadata can include information such as a serial number, part number, or other relevant details. The assigned metadata will appear in the library alongside the captured data.

Functionality:This node allows for the addition of metadata to each capture. The metadata is structured as an object with string keys and values that can be strings or numbers. This ensures that each capture is accompanied by important contextual information, making it easier to identify and reference in the future.

Key Features:

  * Assign metadata to each capture

  * Metadata can include serial numbers, part numbers, or other relevant information

  * Structured as an object with string keys and string or number values

  * Ensures that captures in the library are accompanied by contextual information

  * Enhances traceability and identification of captured data




Usage Scenarios:

  * Adding serial numbers, part numbers, or other identifiers to captured images

  * Providing additional context and information for captures stored in the library

  * Facilitating easier identification and reference of captures during analysis and review

  * Integrating metadata with other nodes and components in the capture and storage system
