## The camera is still not connecting

There is a possibility that the cameraâ€™s IP is not unique.

To ensure effective communication between devices on a network, it's important to assign unique IP addresses to each device, including your camera. This is because sharing IP addresses can cause conflicts and disrupt connectivity. To avoid these conflicts, you can use an IP scanner tool to detect any shared IP addresses and adjust the IP settings of one or more devices. By assigning unique IP addresses to every device, you can optimize the performance of your camera and other networked devices and establish a seamless connection. This will help you get the most out of your camera and ensure your network operates smoothly.  


> ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind**
> 
> Your network might be utilizing the same IP as the camera, like **192.168.0.100** \(some routers have the same default IP\). This can cause a confusion as there is an IP conflict, so it is best to connect with a Micro USB and change the IP to unique IP setting.
