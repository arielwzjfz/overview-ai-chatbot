## Overview

The OV20i includes Node-RED as part of its onboard interface, allowing you to automate notifications and share results in real time. Microsoft Teams supports incoming webhooks that receive messages in JSON format. By setting up a webhook in a Teams channel and configuring the Node-RED flow on the OV20i, you can push updates with image links directly into a shared team workspace.
