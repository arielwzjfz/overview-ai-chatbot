## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  * Node-RED installed and running
  * A Gmail account to use as the sender
  * App password generated for your Gmail account \(standard passwords won't work\)
  * Basic understanding of Node-RED flows



**Important**

For security reasons, Google requires using app passwords instead of your regular account password. This is a one-time setup process.

**Download**

You may need to download the "node-red-node-email" template from Node-RED if the email nodes are not already installed on the camera.
