## Configure pass/fail logic

In the steps below, weâ€™ll walk you through configuring pass/fail logic for a classification recipe using Node-RED logic.

> **Note**
> 
> Ensure all the **AI Blocks** are trained \(green\) before editing the **IO Block**.

  1. Navigate to **IO Block** using the breadcrumb menu or select **Configure I/O** from the **Recipe Editor** page.

  2. Locate the **Classification Block Logic** Node in the default flow, or add it to your flow from the nodes menu on the left. All purple nodes in Node-RED represent Overview Logic Blocks. These blocks are integral to the overall classification logic. For a comprehensive understanding of each block, refer to [_IO Block and Node-RED Logic_](/docs/io-and-node-red-logic).

  3. Double-click on the node to edit it. From the **Inspection Region / ROI** dropdown menu on the left, select the ROI you wish to include in the logic. You can also set a confidence threshold for the inspection. You can use the confidence to tune sensitivity, but generally it is not required.

  4. Select a **Target Class** that the model should identify. For example, select the corresponding target class if you want the model to pass items with a "pass" classification.

  5. If the model requires additional regions of interest, you can add more ROIs to the logic. Additionally, you can select if any or all of the rules must be true in order for the inspection to pass. By default, all rules must pass.

  6. After configuring all necessary settings, click **Done** in the top-right corner and then click on **Deploy** in the top-right corner of the Node-RED editor to save and deploy the logic. Verify that the model operates as expected by testing with sample data from the **HMI** page.
