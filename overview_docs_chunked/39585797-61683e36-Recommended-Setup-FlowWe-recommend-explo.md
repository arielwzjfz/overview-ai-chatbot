We recommend exploring our online resources and experimenting with the camera. A good starting point is:

  * [_Electrical and Communication_](/docs/electrical-and-communication-1)

  * [ _Basic Navigation_](/docs/basic-navigation-1)

  * [ _Creating your first recipe_](/docs/ov80i-creating-your-first-recipe)

  * [ _Creating your first Classification recipe_](/docs/ov80i-creating-your-first-classification-recipe)

  * [ _Creating your first Segmentation recipe_](/docs/ov80i-creating-your-first-segmentation-recipe)

  * [ _Setting up your Ethernet PLC_](/docs/plc-communication-ethernetip-connections-1)




If your communication involves a PLC, we suggest reviewing the "PLC Communication - [_Ethernet_](/docs/plc-communication-ethernetip-connections-1) / [_PROFINET_](/docs/plc-communication-profinet-1) " section.
