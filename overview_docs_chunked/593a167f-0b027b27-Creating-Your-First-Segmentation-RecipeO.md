### Code sample: Pass if the total number of pixels detected is less than the defined threshold

Copy and paste the following logic:
         
         const threshold = 5000; // Define the threshold value for the total pixel count
         
         const allBlobs = msg.payload.segmentation.blobs; // Extract the blobs from the payload's segmentation data
         
         const totalArea = allBlobs.reduce((sum, blob) => sum + blob.pixel_count, 0); // Calculate the total pixel count of all blobs
         
         msg.payload = totalArea < threshold; // Set the payload to true if the total area is less than the threshold, otherwise false
         
         return msg; // Return the modified message object
