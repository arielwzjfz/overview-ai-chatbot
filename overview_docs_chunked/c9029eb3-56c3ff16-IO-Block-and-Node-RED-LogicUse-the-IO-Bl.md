#### **Inspection Pass/Fail**

Description: The "Final Pass/Fail Output Node" is designed to set and store an inspection's final pass/fail state. This node ensures the inspection outcome is clearly defined, communicated, and archived as a boolean value.

Functionality: This node processes the results of an inspection and outputs a boolean value indicating the overall state:

  * True: Indicates that the inspection has passed.

  * False: Indicates that the inspection has failed.




This node outputs the pass/fail state and stores the result for future reference and analysis. This node simplifies the decision-making process in automated inspection systems by providing a clear and recorded pass/fail output. It also ensures that all results are archived for traceability and quality control purposes.

Key Features:

  * Sets and stores the final pass/fail state of an inspection

  * Outputs a boolean value: false for fail and true for pass

  * Ensures clear and unambiguous communication of inspection results

  * Archives inspection results for future reference and analysis

  * Enhances the efficiency of automated quality control processes

  * Integrates seamlessly with other nodes and components in the inspection system




Usage Scenarios:

  * Determining and storing the outcome of quality control inspections in manufacturing

  * Automating decision-making processes based on inspection results

  * Providing a straightforward pass/fail output for integration with downstream systems and processes

  * Ensuring traceability and quality control through archived inspection results
