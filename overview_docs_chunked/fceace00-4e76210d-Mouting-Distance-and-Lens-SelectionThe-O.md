## General Lens Replacement \(6mm to 16mm Lenses\)

Reference

To find where to buy different lenses, refer to this [link](/docs/recommended-accessories-2).

  1. Remove the Faceplate
     * Using a Phillips-head screwdriver, unscrew the four corner screws on the camera's faceplate.
     * Carefully remove the faceplate to expose the LED board and the current lens.
  2. Detach the Existing Lens  
Gently unscrew the existing 12mm lens by turning it counterclockwise.
  3. Install the New Lens
     * Insert the new lens into the camera and hand-tighten it by turning clockwise.



Caution

Do not use tools to tighten the lens. Over-tightening can damage the lens or camera.

  4. Reattach the Faceplate
     * Place the faceplate back onto the camera.
     * Secure it by tightening the four screws removed earlier.
