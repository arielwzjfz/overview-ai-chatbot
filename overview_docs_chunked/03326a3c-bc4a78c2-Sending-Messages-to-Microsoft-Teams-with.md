## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  * Your OV20i is connected to the plant network using a static IP or one provided by IT.
  * Microsoft Teams is accessible from the same network as the OV20i.
  * You have a Teams channel where you want to receive notifications.
  * Node-RED is running on the OV20i and accessible from your browser.



**Important**

The OV20i must be on the same network as your computer and Teams to send data. Ensure it receives a valid IP address from your IT team.
