## Train Segmentation Model

Click to train a segmentation model based on your labeled images.

**Number of Iterations:** Use the arrows on the right-hand side of the field to increase or decrease how many times the labeled images are shown to the model to help it learn.

**Advanced Settings:** Click to access image augmentation options \(flip image, adjust rotation range, image brightness, and contrast\).
