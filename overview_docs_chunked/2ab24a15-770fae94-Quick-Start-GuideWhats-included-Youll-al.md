## Mounting and lens selection

  1. Go to [overview.ai/calculator-for-ov20i](http://overview.ai/calculator-for-ov20i) or use the chart below to calculate the mounting height required for your Field of View \(FoV\). The OV20i is fitted with a 12mm lens. Other lenses sold separately \(see [Recommended Accessories](/docs/recommended-accessories) and [Swapping the Lens](https://docs.overview.ai/docs/mounting-and-mechanical#swapping-the-lens)\).

> **Note**
> 
> The camera has a 4:3 aspect ratio. Multiply the width by 0.75 to calculate the height.

  2. Mount the camera using the plate and hardware provided.

> **Note**
> 
> It’s normal for the OV20i to become hot to touch when powered. For high temperature environments, use the front mounting points.
