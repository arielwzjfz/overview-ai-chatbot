### Connecting via an Ethernet Network

To manually assign a static IP address to the OV80i device, follow these instructions:

  1. Connect to the OV80i software using one of the above methods.

  2. In the OV80i software, go to **Settings** > **System**.

  3. Click **Edit** to change the network settings of the OV80i.

  4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Static IP** option. Enter the appropriate IP address and Subnet Mask. You can also optionally set the Gateway and DNS. If youâ€™re unsure of these settings, check with your network administrator to avoid conflicts with existing devices or other technical difficulties. Once youâ€™ve entered the new network settings, click **Save**.

  5. After changes have been saved, you will see a message prompting you to restart the OV80i to apply the saved changes.

> **Important**
> 
> Take note of the Static IP address you have entered. If you mistyped the IP address information it can be difficult to find the device.

To restart the OV80i device, do one of the following:

     * Go to **System Settings** in the OV80i software, scroll down to **Power** ,**** and click **Reset**.

     * Press the physical **Reset** button on the top of the OV80i camera, near the indicator LEDs.

     * Unplug the camera, wait 5 seconds, then plug it back in.

  6. After the OV80i is restarted, you may use the newly assigned static IP address to access this device from any computer on the same network.




> ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind**
> 
> To prevent IP conflicts and ensure smooth connectivity for your camera, it's essential to configure a unique IP address for each device on your network.
> 
> To detect IP conflicts, use an IP scanner tool to identify any devices sharing the same IP address. If conflicts are found, adjust the IP address of one or more devices to ensure uniqueness and eliminate conflicts.
