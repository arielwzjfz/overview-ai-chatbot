### Requirements

The 25mm lens requires additional components for proper installation. Ensure you have the following items:

  * M12 25mm lens
  * 15mm faceplate spacer
  * Spacer rings
  * 4x M3x22 socket head cap screws



When installing the 25mm lens kit, you may want to optimize resolution at different working distances. In some cases, the lens needs to sit slightly farther out than the full thread depth of the M12 mount. To accommodate this, we use ring spacers.

A practical way to find the correct distance is as follows:

  * Remove the faceplate.
  * Set up your camera configuration.
  * Slowly screw in the lens until you achieve the best imageâ€”try to keep the focus centered on the bar.



Once you have a sharp image, measure how far the lens extends beyond the mount. Then, choose the appropriate combination of ring spacers to match that distance.
