## **Configuring Users and Permissions**

To enable Users and Permissions, click **Enable Account** on one or all three user profiles, and then enter a password that will be used to log in with that profile.

There are three possible users:

User| Default access settings  
---|---  
**Engineer**|  Full access to the OV20i software.  
**Operator**|  Can operate the camera only for the active recipe via the human-machine interface \(HMI\).  
**Supervisor**|  Can select the active recipe and operate the camera through the human-machine interface \(HMI\).  
  
> **Note**
> 
> Users cannot change the default usernames or add additional user profiles, but they can edit the specific permissions for each user \(for example, some users might want to allow the Supervisor profile to edit recipes in addition to the default permissions\).

> **Warning**
> 
> After enabling one or more user profiles, sign in using any profile with **Edit Settings** permissions enabled \(by default, only the **Engineer** profile has this enabled\). Then, disable all permissions for the **Anybody** profile. Otherwise, users intended to have restricted access may simply log out and gain full access to the OV20i software.
