## Timing Diagram

The timing diagram illustrates the sequence of operations within the camera system, highlighting how various signals interactâ€”how one signal triggers another and how the process moves through stages like Trigger, RecipeSwitchRequest and RecipeSwitchAck. The shifts between high and low states in these signals represent changes in the camera's operation, providing insight into the timing and dependencies of each step in the process.
