### Should I Select Classification or Segmentation?

Create a **Classification** Recipe to train a deep-learning model to categorize an image into different classes based on its visual characteristics.

Create a **Segmentation** Recipe to train a deep-learning model to take an image and segment classes at a pixel level based on labeled defects. By operating at a pixel level, this tool is useful for inspections that need finer-grained control over labels.

     3. Enter a **Description** for the Recipe \(optional\). This will appear on the **All Recipes** page and at the top of the **Recipe Editor** page.  


  3. Click **OK** to create the new Recipe.   


  4. The new Recipe will be listed on the **All Recipes** page \(Inactive\).
