## The camera is not connecting to Profinet/Ethernet IP

If all the TCP/IP settings are correct but you are still unable to ping or connect to the camera, the best way to connect would be through the micro USB port on the camera:

  1. Remove the rubber side flap on the OV20i to expose the auxiliary connections. Connect a micro USB cable from the camera \(see image\) to the computer you will use to connect to the OV20i.

  2. Open your browser and enter the IP address **192.168.55.1** to connect to the OV20i software.  


> **Note**
> 
> This IP address never changes and does not require configuration of your network adapter.
