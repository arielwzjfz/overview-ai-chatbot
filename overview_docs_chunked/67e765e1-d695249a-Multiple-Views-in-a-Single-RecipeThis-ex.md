## Test the Recipe

This completes the Node-RED flow and now it's time to test the recipe end-to-end. 

  1. First, we will send the A-side command using our Node-RED **inject node**. Then we will use the HMI to inspect a good part. Notice how despite one of the B-side regions failing, the whole inspection passed.

  2. Now when we remove a drill bit on the A-side, and inspect again, we get the failure result we want.  


  3. Moving on to the B-side, we send the B signal using our Node-RED **inject** and **refresh** the **Flow variable** section in the **context data pane** to make sure that itâ€™s stored.  


  4. Now when we flip to the B-side of a good part, we see that the inspection passes despite the A-side regions all failing.  





Congratulations\! You now know how to use one recipe and model across multiple views of a part. This will allow complex inspections at high speeds and tight integration with robots. It will also save you significant time that would be spent training multiple models that do the same inspection, just on different views
