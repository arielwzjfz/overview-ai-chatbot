## Settings

**Rotation Range:** Enter an angle of 0-180 degrees to define the amount of rotation the aligner will tolerate. Set this to 180 to find parts rotated at any angle. Set this to 0 to find only parts that match the Template Image angle.

**Sensitivity:** Adjust the slider to increase/decrease edge-finding sensitivity. Higher sensitivity settings will find more edges, and lower sensitivity settings will find fewer edges.

**Confidence Threshold:** Use this slider to set the minimum confidence required for an Alignment to be considered valid \(1% indicates an identical match\). This threshold should fall between 0.6-0.9 for consistent alignment.
