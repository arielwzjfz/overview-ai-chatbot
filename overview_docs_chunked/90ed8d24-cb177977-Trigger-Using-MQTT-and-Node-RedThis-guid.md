## Overview

MQTT \(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport\) is a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT devices. Using MQTT with your OV20i camera enables remote triggering and communication with other systems in your network. This approach is particularly useful in production environments where you need to integrate the camera with other automated systems.
