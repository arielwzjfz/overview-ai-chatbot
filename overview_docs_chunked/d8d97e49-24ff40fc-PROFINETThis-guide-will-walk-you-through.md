> To assign a permanent static IP to the camera, users must set it in TIAPortal during the standard procedure for setting up a PROFINET device. If users wish to revert to the default IP address \(192.168.0.100\) and disable PROFINET, they should connect via microUSB at 192.168.55.1, deactivate PROFINET, switch to DHCP with Fallback, and then reboot the camera.
