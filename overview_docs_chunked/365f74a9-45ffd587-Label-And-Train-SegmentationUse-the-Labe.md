## Runtime Settings

**Confidence Score Threshold:** This lets you control the modelâ€™s sensitivity to detecting defects. If you want the model to be very sensitive and detect more things, decrease the slider. If you want the model to be more selective in detecting things, increase the slider.

> **Note**
> 
> You can only adjust this setting when Live Preview Mode is enabled.
