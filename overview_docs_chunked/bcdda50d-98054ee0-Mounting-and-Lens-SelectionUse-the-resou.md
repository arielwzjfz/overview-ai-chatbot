## Calculating the Mounting Distance and Lens Size

The Field of View \(FoV\) is determined by the lens size and the working distance. Refer to the chart below or our [calculator](https://overview.ai/calculator-for-ov20i/) for guidance.

> **Note**
> 
> The OV20i is fitted with a 12mm lens as standard. Other lenses are sold separately.
> 
> Working distance is measured from the front surface of the lens to the subject part.
