## Imaging Setup

In this section, you’ll set up the camera to achieve a clear image of the object being inspected.

> **Note**
> 
> **Imaging Setup** is the same for Classification and Segmentation Recipes.

  1. To configure the **Imaging Setup** , click **Configure Imaging** at the lower left-hand side of the page.

  2. Place the object being inspected in the camera’s field of vision, using the live preview to verify it’s in shot.
