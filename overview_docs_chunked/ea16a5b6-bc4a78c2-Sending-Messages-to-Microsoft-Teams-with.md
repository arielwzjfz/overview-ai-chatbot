### 1\. Create a Webhook in Microsoft Teams

  1. Open Microsoft Teams and go to the channel where you want to receive messages.
  2. Click the three dots \(•••\) next to the channel name >Manage channel > Connectors.
  3. Search for Incoming Webhook and click Add.
  4. Choose a name \(e.g., OV20i Inspection Alerts\) and optionally upload an icon.
  5. Click Create and copy the generated webhook URL. Save it — you'll use it in Node-RED.
