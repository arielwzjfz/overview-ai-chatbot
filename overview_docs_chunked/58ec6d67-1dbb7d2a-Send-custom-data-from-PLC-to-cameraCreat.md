  1. **Create and Configure the Custom Data Tag**  
  
Start by creating two tags, one to copy data from the custom data tag and the other to move it on to the camera output tag. Both have to be a STRING data type.

  2. **Define the Byte Order for Node-RED**  


You can choose any byte order from the output assembly assigned for Node-RED. The byte order refers to how the data is formatted and transmitted.

  3. **Develop Trigger Logic**

  
After creating the custom data tag, use the trigger logic detailed in [Ethernet/IP - Triggering](/docs/trigger-using-a-plc-ethernet) to create a new set of logical instructions. The trigger logic should handle the camera's activation, ensuring that it captures an image whenever specific conditions are met.

> **Note**
> 
> If you trigger the same VIN twice the data wonâ€™t be stored on the second image. Try to clear the data before sending the new one in.

  4. **Create a Flow in Node-RED**

  
Access the Node-RED flow and create a new flow that mirrors the required functionality.  
  
You can use the JSON file provided below to import and set up the logic within Node-RED, ensuring that the flow is configured according to the overall system requirements.

  5. **Capture the Image and Associate Metadata**

  
After triggering the camera, verify that the image capture process is working as expected.

  
Ensure that each image the camera takes has metadata, including the custom data.
