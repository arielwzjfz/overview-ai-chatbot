### Swapping the Lens

The OV20i is fitted with a 12mm lens as standard. If youâ€™ve purchased another size, follow the steps below to change the lens:

  1. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the 4 screws at the corners of the OV20i faceplate.

  2. Remove the faceplate, exposing the LED board and lens.

  3. Unscrew the 12mm lens counterclockwise and remove it from the camera.

  4. 6-16mm Lenses \(expand for instructions\)

     1. Apply Loctite to the lens thread.

     2. Insert the replacement lens and firmly hand-tighten it \(clockwise\).

> **Caution**
> 
> To avoid over-tightening, do not use tools. Hand-tighten only.

  5. 25mm Lens \(expand for instructions\)

An additional kit is provided for the 25mm lens:

     * 1x M12 f/4 25mm lens

     * 1x 15mm faceplate spacer

     * 2x 5mm spacer rings

     * 4x M3x22 socket head cap screws

     1. Install the 2x 5mm spacer rings onto the thread of the lens.

     2. Apply Loctite to the bottom section of the lens thread.

     3. Insert the lens with spacer rings onto the camera and firmly hand-tighten it \(clockwise\).

> **Caution**
> 
> To avoid over-tightening, do not use tools. Hand-tighten only.

     4. Install the 15mm faceplate spacer onto the camera and secure using the 4x M3x22 screws.

  6. Replace the faceplate and screws.
