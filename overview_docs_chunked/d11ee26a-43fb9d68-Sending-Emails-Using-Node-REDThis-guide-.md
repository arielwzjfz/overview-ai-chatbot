### 2\. Generate an App Password

  1. After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to the Security page
  2. Select App passwords \(under "Signing in to Google"\)
  3. Select Mail as the app and Other as the device
  4. Enter a name \(e.g., "Node-RED Email"\)
  5. Click Generate
  6. Google will display a 16-character app password
  7. Copy this password and store it securely â€“ you'll need it for Node-RED



**Note**

This 16-character password will only be shown once. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
