## What is Node-RED?

Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool that provides a browser-based editor for visually connecting hardware devices, APIs, and online services. Originally developed by IBM, it has become an open-source project that offers a low-code approach to automation and data processing.

The OV20i camera leverages Node-RED as its automation platform, allowing you to create sophisticated inspection workflows with minimal coding knowledge. Through a simple drag-and-drop interface, you can quickly develop complex logic that would otherwise require extensive programming expertise.
