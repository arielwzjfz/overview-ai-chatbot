## Navigation

**View All ROIs:** This modal shows each _labeled ROI_ cropped from its parent image. It lets you easily visualize all of your training data and verify that they are all labeled correctly and consistently.

> **Tips to check label integrity**
> 
> Set the opacity slider to 0 to see the images without any labelling overlays and then increase it slowly to 0.5 to make sure the overlays are drawn precisely.

**< Prev:** Click to view the previous captured image.

**> Next:** Click to view the next captured image.

> **Tips to Navigate across captures**
> 
> You can enter the Source Capture number to navigate to a particular image directly.
