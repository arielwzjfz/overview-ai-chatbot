### Advanced Features & Troubleshooting

  * **What is Node-RED in the context of OV20i?** Node-RED is a flow-based development tool used within the OV20i software to configure inspection logic.
  * **How do I configure digital outputs for inspection results?** Use the IO Block to assign outputs based on inspection results, setting conditions in Node-RED.
  * **What should I do if the camera is not connecting via Ethernet?** Ensure your computer's IP settings are correct and that the Ethernet cable is properly connected; refer to the Electrical and Communication guide.
  * **How can I reset the OV20i camera?** You can reset the camera via the System Settings in the software or by pressing the physical reset button on the device.
  * **What is the maximum current for digital outputs?** Each digital output can sink up to 100mA when active.
  * **How do I prevent IP conflicts on my network?** Assign unique static IP addresses to each device and use IP scanner tools to detect conflicts.
  * **Can I use the OV20i in high-temperature environments?** Yes, but ensure proper mounting and ventilation; use front mounting points for better heat dissipation.
  * **What is the function of the 'Skip Aligner' option?** It allows you to bypass the alignment step during recipe setup if alignment is not necessary for your application.
  * **How do I update the OV20i firmware?** Use the Software Update section in the toolbar to upload and install firmware updates.
