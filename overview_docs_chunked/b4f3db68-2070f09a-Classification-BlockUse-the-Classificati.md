## Navigation

**View All ROIs:** This modal shows each ROI cropped from its parent image. This is useful for visualizing all training data together on a grid-style page and can also efficiently be used to re-label data. This can be done in two ways:

  1. Click on an image to view information about that ROI, such as the parent image and Inspection Type. You can also change its label here.

  2. Select multiple images by clicking on the checkbox for each image. Then, you can configure the selected images using the options at the bottom of the page \(**Label Selected ROIs** , **Unlabel Selected ROIs** , **Clear Selection**\).




**< Prev:** Click to view the previous captured image.

**> Next:** Click to view the next captured image.
