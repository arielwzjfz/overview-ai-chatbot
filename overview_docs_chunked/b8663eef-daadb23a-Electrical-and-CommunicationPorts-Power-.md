### Connecting Directly via USB

  1. Remove the rubber side flap on the OV20i to expose the auxiliary connections. Connect a micro USB cable from the camera \(see image\) to the computer you will use to connect to the OV20i.

  2. Open your browser and enter the IP address **192.168.55.1** to connect to the OV20i software.
