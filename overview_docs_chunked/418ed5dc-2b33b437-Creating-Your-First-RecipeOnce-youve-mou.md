## Inspection Setup

In this section, you’ll configure what you want the camera to inspect \(**Inspection Types**\) and where on the object you want it to perform the inspection \(**Inspection Regions**\).

> **Note**
> 
> **Inspectoin Setup** is the same for Classification and Segmentation Recipes.

  1. Select the **Inspection Setup** tab. Alternatively, select **Inspection Setup** from the **Recipe Editor**.

> **Note**
> 
> The preview pane \(on the left-hand side\) displays the **Template Image** , not a live preview of the camera’s field of vision. To view a live preview from the camera, scroll down the page and select **Live Preview Mode**. To add or edit **Inspection Types** and **Inspection Regions** , ensure the live preview is not enabled.

  2. Under **Inspection Types** , “Inspection Type 1” will appear by default. Click **Edit** to rename it.

> **Note**
> 
> **Inspection Types** refer the different types \(classes\) of inspections being performed and allow you to group visually similar **Inspection Regions** \(ROIs\). **Inspection Regions** \(ROIs\) refer to the area\(s\) where the inspection should be performed.

  3. Under **Inspection Regions** , click **\+ Add Inspection Region**.

> **Note**
> 
> By default, the **Inspection Region** will be named “New ROI”. Click **Edit** to change the name.

  5. Add as many **Inspection Types** and **Inspection regions** as required for this Recipe.   


  6. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page and continue to [Next Steps](/v1/docs/ov80i-creating-your-first-recipe#next-steps).
