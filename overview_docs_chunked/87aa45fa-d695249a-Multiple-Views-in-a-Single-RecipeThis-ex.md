## Create and Train a New Recipe

Instead of one recipe per side, because of the different layouts, we will combine both sides into one recipe so we donâ€™t need to train the same presence/absence model twice.

  1. Create a recipe. In this case, it is a classification recipe but this same principle can be used with segmentation.

  2. Set up the **Template Image and Alignment** for the first view:  


> **Note**
> 
> The Aligner is unavailable when inspecting more than one view on the same recipe. The Template Image and Aligner is only used to set the base image for the **Inspection Setup**.

  3. Draw ROIs for side A. Name them something that helps identify which side they belong to. In this case, we named the ROIs A1-A16.   


  4. Return to the **Template Image and Alignment** to replace the image with side B, either from a new capture or from the library.

  5. Use the lock icons next to each ROI to avoid moving any ROIs from side A, then draw and name the ROIs for side B.  


> **Note**
> 
> For more complex recipes, repeat this process for as many different views as you want to inspect.

  6. Label and train the classification model using images from both sides A and B. When capturing and labeling side A, do not label the side B ROIs and vice versa.

Labeling side A, Pass

Labeling side A, Fail

Labeling side B, Pass
