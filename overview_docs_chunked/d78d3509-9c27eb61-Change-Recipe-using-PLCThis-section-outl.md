This section outlines the process for changing the recipe in the camera using PLC logic. Each step and corresponding action are detailed to ensure proper integration and functionality.

> **Note**
> 
> Make sure that the Recipe switch is not always high before triggering.

**_Steps to Change Recipe_**

  1. Connect the Camera to the PLC. Refer to [Ethernet/IP - Establishing Communication](/docs/plc-communication-ethernetip-connections).




**_Important tags and steps_**

  * Set the recipe number you want to use by moving it to the Camera\_1:O.Data\[4\] register.

  * Trigger the RECIPE\_SWITCH

  * Check Camera\_1:I.Data\[1\].6 to ensure the camera is not busy before triggering the recipe switch. Use a one-shot rising edge signal Recipe\_ONS to trigger the switch.

  * Latch the Recipe Switch Request, Camera\_1:O.Data\[0\].1 to send the recipe switch request.

  * Verify Recipe Match and Acknowledgment

  * Once both conditions are met, the recipe match is confirmed.

  * Unlatch the Recipe Switch Request




** _Error Handling_**

  * After confirming the recipe match, unlatch the Camera\_1:O.Data\[0\].1 bit to complete the recipe switch process.

  * Monitor for errors during the process.

  * If an error occurs, Camera\_1:I.Data\[1\].1 will turn true.




**_Key Points_**

  * Camera Connection: Ensure proper connection between the camera and PLC.

  * Recipe Number: Move the desired recipe number to Camera\_1:O.Data\[4\].

  * RECIPE\_SWITCH Trigger: Use Recipe\_ONS to trigger the switch while ensuring the camera is not busy \(Camera\_1:I.Data\[1\].6\).

  * Latch Recipe Switch Request: Set and latch Camera\_1:O.Data\[0\].1 for the switch request.

  * Verify Recipe and Acknowledge: Confirm match between Camera\_1:I.Data\[8\] and Camera\_1:O.Data\[4\] and check Camera\_1:I.Data\[0\].2.

  * Unlatch Request: Unlatch Camera\_1:O.Data\[0\].1 after confirmation.

  * Error Monitoring: Watch for Camera\_1:I.Data\[1\].1 to handle any errors.
