## Capture/Import

**Capture:** This lets you take a new Capture and use it to train a model.

> **Note**
> 
> While in Live Preview Mode, clicking on one of the labels under Inspection Types will trigger a Capture and label all ROIs of that type to that label class.

**Import From Library:** This lets you add images stored in your [Library](/v1/docs/library) and use them for model training.
