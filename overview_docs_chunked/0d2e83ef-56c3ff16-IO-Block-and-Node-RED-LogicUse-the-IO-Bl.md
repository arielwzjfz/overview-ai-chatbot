#### **Output**

Description: The "Digital Output Node" is designed to control the output pins on the M12 connector of the OV20i. The node turns the pins on or off based on boolean values.

Functionality:

  * True: Turns the pin ON.

  * False: Turns the pin OFF.




Digital Output nodes are straightforward in operation and do not have editable properties, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

Pin Configuration:

**Pin \#**| **Pigtail**| **Description**  
---|---|---  
10| Violet| Output 1  
11| Gray / Pink| Output 2  
  
Key Features:

  * Controls the output pins on the M12 connector of the OV20i

  * Boolean values determine the state of the pins \(ON/OFF\)

  * No editable properties, ensuring simplicity and reliability




Usage Scenarios:

  * Automating control processes by turning specific output pins on or off.

  * Integrating with other control systems for coordinated operations.

  * Providing a straightforward interface for digital output control on the OV20i
