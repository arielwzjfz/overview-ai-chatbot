Let us talk you through the features you’ll find on every page of the OV20i software.

| **Home Button** : Click on the Overview logo in the top-left corner to return to [All Recipes \(Home Page\)](/docs/recipe-management).  
---|---  
| **Version and Serial number** : The current software version and device serial number are displayed in the top-right corner, which is useful information to provide when requesting support.  
| **User Login** : Click here to sign in using a user profile. User profiles are disabled by default—to use them, you must first configure [Users and Permissions](/docs/users-and-permissions).  
| **Toolbar** : The Toolbar on the left side of the screen is used to access different menus for operating the camera, viewing saved images, analyzing model results, and more.

  * [All Recipes \(Home Page\)](/docs/recipe-management): This is a place to create, view, and edit active Recipes on the OV20i.
  * [HMI](/docs/hmi): View live image results from the active Recipe, manually trigger the camera, and switch between Recipes.
  * [Library](/docs/library): View and search all images captured by the camera. Library images can also be selected and added to the training datasets of existing Recipes.
  * Haystack \(Beta\): Use intuitive visualization tools to quickly hone in on model trends and performance indicators.
  * Industrial Ethernet:
    * Enable [Ethernet/IP](/docs/plc-communication-ethernetip-connections) or [PROFINET](/docs/plc-communication-profinet) communication, download PLC configuration files, and view documentation on tag mapping.
  * Digital Outputs: Check the real-time status of the digital output pins \(configured in [IO Block](/docs/io-and-node-red-logic)\).
  * [Users and Permissions](/docs/users-and-permissions): Enable user profiles and manage permissions.
  * [System Settings](/docs/settings): View and edit the device network settings, system time, and device storage, download system logs, and restart the camera remotely.
  * [Software Update](/docs/software-update): Upload and install software updates to access the latest OV20i Vision System updates and features.
  * User Manual: Access an offline copy of this user manual, current to the release date of the current software version of your device.

> **Note** For the latest user manual, go to <https://docs.overview.ai/> \(requires internet connection\).

  * Overview Support: Send an e-mail to [support@overview.ai](mailto:support@overview.ai) using your computer’s preferred e-mail application.
