## Train Classification Model

There are two modes a model can train. **Fast** and **Accurate**.

**Fast:** It is useful when iterating on the problem. It trains significantly faster, but it is generally less accurate. It will also run slower in production as it is not optimized.

**Accurate:** Production grade model.

**Number of Iterations:** Use the arrows on the right-hand side of the field to increase or decrease how many times the labeled images are shown to the model to help it learn.

**Advanced Settings:** Click to access image augmentation options \(flip image, adjust rotation range, image brightness, and contrast\).
