## Managing and Creating Recipes

The All Recipes page is the home page for the OV20i software \(pictured below\). A Recipe is a unique inspection program, although it can contain many different inspections \(Regions of Interest or ROIs\) within it. Typically, a new Recipe is created for a different part or SKU to be inspected, or a different section of a larger part \(if the camera or part is being presented by robot\). Only one Recipe is active at a time. A Recipe must be active in order for it to be run or edited.
