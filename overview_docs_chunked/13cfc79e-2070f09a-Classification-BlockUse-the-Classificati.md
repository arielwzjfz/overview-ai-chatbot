## Inspection Types

Click ✏️ **Edit** above a group to edit or add the labels for each Inspection Type. You can also change the label color and name and add/remove classes.

There are two ways of labeling new data:

  1. Clicking the labels in the Inspection Types panel will label all ROIs of that Inspection Type to that label class. This can be useful when most labels are of the same class.

  2. Clicking the ROIs on the image window will cycle through all valid labels for that inspection type.
