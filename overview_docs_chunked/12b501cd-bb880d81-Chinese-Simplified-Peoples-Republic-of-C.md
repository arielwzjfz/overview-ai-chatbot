### Classification & Segmentation

  * **What is a Classification recipe used for?** Classification recipes are used to categorize images into predefined classes based on visual features.
  * **What is a Segmentation recipe used for?** Segmentation recipes identify and label specific regions within an image, useful for detecting defects or features.
  * **How do I train a Segmentation model?** After setting up imaging and inspection, label the regions of interest and train the model using the provided tools.
  * **Can I use the same images for both Classification and Segmentation?** Yes, images stored in the Library can be used for training both types of models.
  * **How do I evaluate model performance?** After training, review the accuracy metrics and validation results provided in the software.
  * **Can I retrain a model with additional data?** Yes, you can add more labeled images and retrain the model to improve accuracy.
  * **What is the purpose of the Confidence Threshold in classification?** It sets the minimum confidence level required for a classification to be considered valid.
  * **How do I handle multiple ROIs in a single recipe?** You can define multiple ROIs during the Inspection Setup and configure logic for each in the IO Block.
  * **Can I export trained models?** The documentation does not specify model export functionality; contact support for more information.
  * **How do I delete or deactivate a recipe?** In the All Recipes page, use the Actions menu next to the recipe to deactivate or delete it.
