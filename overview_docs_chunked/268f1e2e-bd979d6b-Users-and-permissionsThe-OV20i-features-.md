Thank you for your feedback\!

The OV20i features a Users and Permissions system to restrict functionalities behind a password. By default, the users and permissions system is disabled, and any user with network access has full access to the OV20i.

The users and permissions settings are an essential part of any system involving multiple users. These settings allow you to control who can access certain parts of the system and what actions they can perform. By assigning different access levels to different users, you can ensure that each person has the appropriate level of permissions to carry out their tasks while keeping sensitive data secure. Using the users and permissions settings, you can ensure that each user has access only to the data they need, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
