### Power I/O Connector Pinout and Wiring

![Pinout and wiring diagram of the OV20i M12 17-Pin power connector](https://cdn.document360.io/863daf20-40fe-49e9-9c91-e3c6cfba55d1/Images/Documentation/OV20i M12 17-Pin Wiring Diagram.png)

> **Note**
> 
>   1. When active, output sinks to GND. Max 100mA. When not active, output is floating. Requires an external power supply.
> 
>   2. Pull to GND to activate input.
> 
>   3. Pull to GND to reboot the camera. This is not needed for most applications. Keep floating to avoid unexpected restarts.
> 
>   4. DIO GND must be connected to GND for digital input functionality to work. DIO GND is tied to GND through a thermal fuse. When connecting the OV20iâ€™s digital I/O lines to a system that is powered from a different power supply, use this pin to tie the grounds together.
> 
>   5. If there is insufficient power, modify the wiring to ensure that the 24V power supply is connected to both ports, rather than only connecting it to a single terminal. This adjustment is necessary to maintain consistent voltage across all required components.
