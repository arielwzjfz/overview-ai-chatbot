  2. Connect a computer to the camera by either:

     * **Micro USB**

Connect a micro USB cable at the side of the camera. Open your browser and go to **192.168.55.1**.

     * **Ethernet**

Connect the Ethernet cable to the camera. Configure your Ethernet adapter to IP **192.168.0.10** \(Subnet mask **255.255.255.0**\), and then open your web browser and go to **192.168.0.100**.
