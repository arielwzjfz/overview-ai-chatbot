### Introduction to Node-RED

Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool that provides a browser-based editor for connecting hardware devices, APIs, and online services. It represents a low-code approach to automation, making it accessible to users regardless of programming background. The OV20i camera system leverages Node-RED as its automation platform, allowing you to create powerful inspection workflows with minimal coding.
