## Preview

If a **Template Image** has not yet been captured for this recipe, the preview pane \(on the left-hand side\) displays a live preview of the camera’s field of vision.

Once the **Template Image** has been captured, the preview pane will display the **Template Image** , not a live preview of the camera’s field of vision. To view a live preview from the camera, scroll down the page and select **Live Preview Mode**. To retake the **Template Image** , ensure the live preview is not enabled and click **Re-Capture Template Image**.
