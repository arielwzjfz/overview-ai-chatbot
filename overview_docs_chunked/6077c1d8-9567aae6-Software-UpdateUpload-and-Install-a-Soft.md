## Upload and Install a Software Update

  1. Select **Software Update** from the OV20i Toolbar.

  2. Click the link on the right-hand side \(<https://updates.overview.ai/latest>\) to download the latest OV20i software update file to your computer.

> **Release Notes**
> 
> For a complete explanation of whatâ€™s been added or upgraded in each version, view the [Release Notes](/docs/software-updates-release-notes).

  3. Once downloaded, drag and drop the software file \(.ovupdate\) onto the top-left corner of the page to upload the update file to the camera.

  4. The upload will take up to 10 minutes, and then the file will continue to process on the device. Once uploaded, the camera will automatically begin to install the update.

> **Note**
> 
> Keep the camera plugged in and connected to power while the update is being installed. The installation will take up to 20 minutes and the camera may become unresponsive and restart.

  5. Once installed, a notification will appear indicating that the update has been installed successfully.
