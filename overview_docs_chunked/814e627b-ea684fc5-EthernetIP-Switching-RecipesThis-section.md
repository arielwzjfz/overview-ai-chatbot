### Breakdown of the Timing Diagram

  * **Busy** :

The "Busy" signal shows whether the system is engaged in a process. It starts low \(inactive\), goes high when the process begins, and stays high throughout the entire operation. Once the operation is complete, the signal returns low, indicating the system is no longer busy and is ready for the next task.

  * **TriggerRdy \(Trigger Ready\)** :

This signal indicates when the system is ready to receive a trigger command. The signal starts high, indicating readiness, and then goes low during the operation, remaining low until the system has completed its current task. At the end of the process, the signal goes high again, indicating that the system is ready for the next trigger.

  * **RecipeSwitchAck \(Recipe Switch Acknowledge\)** :

The "Recipe Switch Acknowledge" signal confirms that a recipe switch request has been processed by the system. The signal goes high briefly to acknowledge the request, then returns low, indicating that the acknowledgement process is complete.

  * **RecipeSwitchRequest** :

This signal initiates a recipe switch. The signal goes high to request a recipe change and stays high for a short duration, allowing the system to register the request. Once the system has acknowledged the request and begun processing it, the signal returns low, completing the request cycle.




The **Busy** signal tracks whether the system is occupied, while **TriggerRdy** shows when the system is ready to accept new commands. The **RecipeSwitchRequest** signal initiates a recipe switch, and **RecipeSwitchAck** confirms that the switch has been accepted and processed.

This sequence ensures that recipe switches are handled smoothly and are critical in ensuring that the system operates without conflicts, allowing for smooth transitions between different operational states.

Program the logic using a similar example, PFA the logic attached.

> **Warning**
> 
> Make sure the PLC is only sending a recipe switch request when needed, since setting recipe switch high will block triggering.
