## Timing Diagram

The timing diagram visualizes the sequence of operations within the camera system. It shows the relationship between different signalsâ€”how one signal triggers another and how the process progresses through various stages, such as triggering, exposure, inspection, and completion. The transitions between high and low states on these signals represent the state changes in the camera's operation and help understand the timing and dependencies between each part of the process.
