### Field of View \(FoV\) Widths at 100mm, 1m, and 2m mounting distances

> **Note**
> 
> The camera has a 4:3 aspect ratio. The dimensions provided below refer to the width of the FoV. Multiply the width by 0.75 to calculate the height at the same distance.

---|---|---|---  
6mm| 83mm| 825mm| 1650mm  
8mm| 62mm| 619mm| 1238mm  
12mm \(default\)| 40mm| 405mm| 810mm
