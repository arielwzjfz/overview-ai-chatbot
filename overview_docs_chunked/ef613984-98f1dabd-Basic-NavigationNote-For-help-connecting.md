Let us talk you through the features you’ll find on every page of the OV80i software.

---|---  
| **Version and Serial number** : The current software version and device serial number are displayed in the top-right corner, which is useful information to provide when requesting support.  
| **User Login** : Click here to sign in using a user profile. User profiles are disabled by default—to use them, you must first configure [Users and Permissions](/docs/users-and-permissions).

  * Recipe Editor: Here you can edit the active recipe.
  * HMI: View live image results from the active Recipe, manually trigger the camera, and switch between Recipes.
  * Library: View and search all images captured by the camera. Library images can also be selected and added to the training datasets of existing Recipes.
  * Haystack: Use intuitive visualization tools to quickly hone in on model trends and performance indicators.
  * Industrial Ethernet:
    * Enable [Ethernet/IP](/docs/plc-communication-ethernetip-connections) or [PROFINET](/docs/plc-communication-profinet) communication, download PLC configuration files, and view documentation on tag mapping.
  * Digital Outputs: Check the real-time status of the digital output pins \(configured in [IO Block](/docs/io-and-node-red-logic)\).
  * [Users and Permissions](/docs/users-and-permissions): Enable user profiles and manage permissions.
  * [System Settings](/docs/settings): View and edit the device network settings, system time, and device storage, download system logs, and restart the camera remotely.
