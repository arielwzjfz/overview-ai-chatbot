## General Questions

### Hardware & Setup

  * **What components are included with the OV20i?** The OV20i package includes a camera unit, a 12mm lens, and a power I/O cable.
  * **What additional items do I need for installation?** You'll need a 24V power supply, an Ethernet cable, and a compatible mounting bracket.
  * **How do I determine the appropriate mounting height?** Use the calculator at https://overview.ai/calculator-for-ov20i to determine the required mounting height based on your desired field of view.
  * **What are the available connection ports on the OV20i?** The OV20i features HDMI \(not used\), USB Type-C, M12 A-Coded 17 Pin \(Power I/O\), M12 X-Coded Ethernet, and micro-USB ports.
  * **How do I connect the OV20i via USB?** Connect a micro-USB cable from the camera to your computer and access the software at 192.168.55.1.
  * **How do I connect the OV20i via Ethernet?** Connect through the M12 Ethernet port, set your computer's IP to 192.168.0.10, and access the camera at 192.168.0.100.
  * **Can I assign a static IP address to the OV20i?** Yes, navigate to Settings > System in the OV20i software to configure a static IP address.
  * **What is the function of the M12 A-Coded 17 Pin connector?** It's used for Power I/O connections, including digital inputs and outputs.
  * **Is the HDMI port functional on the OV20i?** No, the HDMI port is not used in the OV20i.
  * **What should I do if the OV20i becomes hot during operation?** It's normal for the OV20i to become warm; ensure proper ventilation and use front mounting points in high-temperature environments.



### Software Navigation

  * **How do I access the OV20i software interface?** Connect the camera via USB or Ethernet and enter the appropriate IP address in your web browser.
  * **What is the 'All Recipes' page?** It's the home page where you can create, view, and manage all your recipes.
  * **What does the HMI section display?** The HMI \(Human-Machine Interface\) shows live image results from the active recipe and allows manual camera triggering.
  * **What is the purpose of the Library section?** The Library stores all images captured by the camera, which can be used for training datasets.
  * **What is the Haystack feature?** Haystack provides visualization tools to analyze model trends and performance indicators.
  * **How can I update the OV20i software?** Navigate to the Software Update section in the toolbar to upload and install updates.
  * **Where can I find system logs and settings?** Under System Settings, you can view and edit network settings, system time, and device storage, and download system logs.
  * **How do I enable user profiles and permissions?** Go to Users and Permissions in the toolbar to configure user access and roles.
  * **How can I access the user manual offline?** Click on the User Manual section in the toolbar to download an offline copy of the manual.
  * **How do I contact Overview.ai support?** Use the Overview Support section in the toolbar to send an email to support@overview.ai.



### Recipe Creation & Training

  * **How do I create a new recipe?** From the All Recipes page, click '+ New Recipe', enter a name, select the recipe type, and click OK.
  * **What are the types of recipes I can create?** You can create Classification and Segmentation recipes.
  * **How do I configure imaging settings?** In the Recipe Editor, click 'Configure Imaging' to adjust focus, exposure, gamma, and LED light patterns.
  * **What is the purpose of the Template Image and Alignment step?** It allows you to capture a reference image and align the inspection area; you can also choose to skip this step.
  * **How do I set up the Inspection Region of Interest \(ROI\)?** In the Inspection Setup, adjust the ROI box to focus on the specific area you want to analyze.
  * **How many images are needed for training a classification model?** A minimum of 5 different images per class is recommended for effective training.
  * **What training options are available for classification models?** You can choose between 'Fast' for quick testing and 'Accurate' for production use, adjusting iterations accordingly.
  * **How do I monitor training progress?** A training progress modal displays the current iteration number and accuracy; you can abort or finish training early if needed.
  * **How do I view live results after training?** Click 'Live Preview' in the Recipe Editor to see real-time classification results.
  * **Can I configure pass/fail logic for inspections?** Yes, use the IO Block in the Recipe Editor to set up logic using Node-RED for pass/fail criteria.



### Classification & Segmentation

  * **What is a Classification recipe used for?** Classification recipes are used to categorize images into predefined classes based on visual features.
  * **What is a Segmentation recipe used for?** Segmentation recipes identify and label specific regions within an image, useful for detecting defects or features.
  * **How do I train a Segmentation model?** After setting up imaging and inspection, label the regions of interest and train the model using the provided tools.
  * **Can I use the same images for both Classification and Segmentation?** Yes, images stored in the Library can be used for training both types of models.
  * **How do I evaluate model performance?** After training, review the accuracy metrics and validation results provided in the software.
  * **Can I retrain a model with additional data?** Yes, you can add more labeled images and retrain the model to improve accuracy.
  * **What is the purpose of the Confidence Threshold in classification?** It sets the minimum confidence level required for a classification to be considered valid.
  * **How do I handle multiple ROIs in a single recipe?** You can define multiple ROIs during the Inspection Setup and configure logic for each in the IO Block.
  * **Can I export trained models?** The documentation does not specify model export functionality; contact support for more information.
  * **How do I delete or deactivate a recipe?** In the All Recipes page, use the Actions menu next to the recipe to deactivate or delete it.



### Advanced Features & Troubleshooting

  * **What is Node-RED in the context of OV20i?** Node-RED is a flow-based development tool used within the OV20i software to configure inspection logic.
  * **How do I configure digital outputs for inspection results?** Use the IO Block to assign outputs based on inspection results, setting conditions in Node-RED.
  * **What should I do if the camera is not connecting via Ethernet?** Ensure your computer's IP settings are correct and that the Ethernet cable is properly connected; refer to the Electrical and Communication guide.
  * **How can I reset the OV20i camera?** You can reset the camera via the System Settings in the software or by pressing the physical reset button on the device.
  * **What is the maximum current for digital outputs?** Each digital output can sink up to 100mA when active.
  * **How do I prevent IP conflicts on my network?** Assign unique static IP addresses to each device and use IP scanner tools to detect conflicts.
  * **Can I use the OV20i in high-temperature environments?** Yes, but ensure proper mounting and ventilation; use front mounting points for better heat dissipation.
  * **What is the function of the 'Skip Aligner' option?** It allows you to bypass the alignment step during recipe setup if alignment is not necessary for your application.
  * **How do I update the OV20i firmware?** Use the Software Update section in the toolbar to upload and install firmware updates.
